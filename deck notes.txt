Do not know how I will load cards from the file

Chase suggested we load in a couple card manually.

What do i want to do with the manual cards?
	* load in cards 
	* able to select which cards i want
	* able to select as many of the card as i want
	* able to add as many lands as i want
	* see deck size 
	* all will be through terminal at first



steps:
	* need a deck class 
	* need a card class
	* deck class contains cards
	* only want to practice with one deck currently 
	* only really need 6 cards or so to test.
	* do i save the cards to a file? or do i read from a file to load the cards?



Brainstorm:
search tree for sets
Donâ€™t do what lackey did on card search
Lackey GUI
Text file to deck
